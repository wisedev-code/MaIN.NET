# M.A.I.N

M.A.I.N (Modular Artificial Intelligence Network) is a versatile .NET package designed to streamline the integration of large language models (LLMs) into advanced AI workflows. Whether you're developing chatbots, automating processes, or exploring innovative AI techniques, M.A.I.N offers a flexible and robust foundation to build upon. The name reflects our core vision—a modular network connecting diverse AI methods into one unified ecosystem.

Please star the repo to show your support for this project! ⭐️

The work on the package started with the learning and inspiration gained by using the [LLamaSharp](https://github.com/SciSharp/LLamaSharp) project and currently this project powers the local models. If you like this project, show your love also to them ❤️
