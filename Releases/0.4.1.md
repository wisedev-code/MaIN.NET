# 0.4.1 Release

- Knowledge feature including 3 examples with web source, file source, and MCP source.

### Knowledge Database
This feature enables the creation of agents that can provide impressive data sourcing with minimal context. This is achieved by persisting knowledge as an index.json file, which contains a set of sources with assigned tasks. All prompts for agents using this feature can verify if there is a matching tag in the knowledge memory and use only that information to answer questions. To understand how it works, the best way is to check out the examples.
